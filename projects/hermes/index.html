<h2>HERMES: Electromagnetically Rapidly Exploring Trees</h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> A novel path-planning algorithm inspired by electron motion and electromagnetic fields.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combines <strong>A*</strong> and <strong>RRT*</strong> with physics-based cost functions.</li>
  <li>Finds the <strong>path of least resistance</strong> while avoiding obstacles.</li>
  <li>Faster convergence and smoother paths than traditional planners.</li>
  <li>Potential applications: drones, surgical robots, autonomous vehicles.</li>
</ul>
